          One of North Star Law's main focus is looking after non-domiciliaries in the UK.
          Whether the client is a high net-worth individual,
          entrepreneur or just a young person venturing abroad in the hope of realising their dreams we can help.
          We help clients move to the UK, while they are in the UK and help them with their departure from the UK.
          North Star Law’s interest in each client means we are on call to "hold the client’s hand".
